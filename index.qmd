### Introduction {.highlight-row}

#### How does the music we listen to, define us? 

Music is far more than a background element of daily life; it is a tool for emotional regulation and a primary architect of personal identity. While clinical studies have explored “music therapy” in controlled settings, there is a growing need to understand how consuming music daily functions as a coping mechanism in the real world. For international students, this relationship becomes more complex as they navigate the transition between two cultural environments.

When individuals move to a new country, they face the challenge of preserving their old self while integrating into a host society. This study addresses the tension between the pull of the familiar and the push of the new. We propose that listening to cultural music while studying acts as a protective factor, increasing happiness and reducing the cognitive load of a new environment. We also anticipate that the move itself triggers an increase in the consumption of home-country music compared to when the student was living at home, driven primarily by nostalgia.

This leads to our Primary Research Problem: “Do international students lean into songs from their home country as a response to nostalgia and homesickness, or do they prioritize cultural integration by adopting the music of their new environment?”

Using a Qualtrics survey, we gathered qualitative insights into participants’ emotional states, focusing on feelings of homesickness and their connection to heritage. By comparing a student’s top songs from their first year in the Netherlands to their current listening habits, we map the trajectory of cultural integration and observe whether nostalgia represents a permanent shift or a temporary phase that gives way to a more global or local musical palate.

Preliminary data collection suggests that international students do maintain a stronger tie to their home-country music than their local Dutch counterparts. From the chart we see that that for international students, 28% of their Top 3 songs originate from their home country. In contrast, Dutch students showed a much lower reliance on domestic music, with only 12% of their top songs being Dutch and a staggering 88% consisting of international music. This 16% difference in song choice between international and Dutch students hint a little at the unique role home-country music plays for international students. It is essentially a tool to cope with the alien environment. 

*Beyond the origin of the music, we analyzed the acoustic of the songs using Speechiness, Danceability, and Energy.*


## Column 2 {width=40%}

### Row 1 {.highlight-row}

**Danceability:** Taiwan, Finland, and Ukraine show lower danceability, suggesting a preference for slower, melodic, atmospheric music, while Russia’s higher danceability may reflect using energetic rhythms to boost mood and counter homesickness.

**Energy:** High-energy music functions as emotional catharsis; despite living abroad, students may rely on intense tracks to express feelings and regulate the stress of adapting to a new country.

**Speechiness:** Higher speechiness for Taiwan and Finland indicates a stronger role of spoken language in music, implying that lyrics and storytelling help students maintain a linguistic and emotional connection to home.

**Home music influence on the international students** 
  
The radar chart illustrates how international students see home-country music as an 'emotional bridge' when living abroad. Across all measured dimensions, students who include music from home in their top three songs report consistently higher scores, ranging from reduced loneliness to better emotional adjustment in a new environment. Because the purple shape surrounds the pink one completely, it indicates that home-country music provides a total boost to mental well-being, rather than just helping in one specific area. 

## Column 2 {width=40%}

### Row 1 {.highlight-row}

**Emotional impact of the home country songs**

The data shows nearly identical reactions in both groups, challenging the assumption that homesickness makes international students more nostalgic.

**Nostalgia:** Dutch and international students show nearly identical nostalgia responses (4.68 vs 4.44 median), suggesting being abroad does not automatically intensify musical nostalgia.

**Mood:** Students who include home-country music report a higher median mood score (4.08 vs 3.04), indicating a clear positive emotional benefit.

**Loneliness:** Those listening to home-country music also report higher loneliness (3.88 vs 3.00), implying nostalgic music may act as a coping tool rather than eliminating loneliness.

**Distribution of Music Origin by Residency Duration ** 
  
This graph shows a counter-intuitive trend where rather than declining, time spent overseas is associated with increasing frequency of listening to music from one's home country. 

Long-term Residents, meaning students who have lived in the Netherlands for longer than a year dedicate approximately 35%, song choices to their home country. 

Short-term Residents, as in the new arrivals, conversely, listen to very little music from home, dedicating only 10%. 

This might show that new students might be eager to immerse themselves into the newer environment, while long-term residents eventually return to their musical roots for comfort.

### Row 1 {.highlight-row}

**Influence of the distance**

This graph disproves the assumption that students from further away rely more heavily on home-country music. The p-value of 0.3 is well above the standard threshold 0.05, indicating that any observed pattern here is likely due to random chance rather than a true trend. 

Nostalgia from music is not a geographical variable, rather it is an emotional variable. Simply being far from home would not trigger a retreat to home country music.

### Row 2 
#### Playlists

**Spotify playlists**

These are the playlists that were made according to each respondent's country of origin with the songs that they were listening.
 Of course it cannot reflect the countries musical culture, but we think It is a nice opportunity to experience a musical life of different international students. 



#### Fun facts 🎵 {.highlight-row}

**Fun facts**

- Lithuanian respondents were the only group whose top songs consisted entirely of music from their own country(based on 3 responses). It also holds for Italy and Spain in our research, but there were only 1 respondent per each of these countries. 
- There was a Dutch response which consisted of 2 Japanese and 1 Chinese songs. 


## Column 3

**Conclusion**
  
Our research set out to determine whether international students use music to cling to the past or to integrate into their new future. The data reveals that the answer is not a simple binary, but a dynamic timeline of emotional regulation. 

While some variables in our study were not subjected to rigorous statistical testing, three key patterns emerged that clarify this relationship: 

**1:** *Stronger Connection to Roots:* International students listen to significantly more music from their home country (28%) compared to Dutch students listening to their own domestic music (12%). This confirms that for those abroad, music serves as a stronger cultural anchor than for those living in their own environment. 

**2:** *Nostalgia:* Contrary to the assumption that international students would be uniquely driven by homesickness, our data shows that nostalgia is a shared human experience. Both Dutch and international students reported similarly high levels of nostalgic feeling, proving that music connects us to our past regardless of geographic distance. 

**3:** *Alleviating Loneliness:* Perhaps most importantly, we observed that music functions as a vital coping mechanism rather than a cure. Students who listen to home-country music reported lower levels of loneliness compared to those who do not. Simultaneously, they reported significantly higher mood scores. This indicates that lonely students actively turn to home music to regulate their emotions, successfully boosting their happiness despite their isolation.  


In the end, international students do not choose between integration and nostalgia. Rather, they use music as a flexible, self-control mechanism. Thanks everyone for participation.
